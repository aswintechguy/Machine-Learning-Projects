## Cat Image Classifier

### Logistic Regression
Welcome to the Logistic Regression - Cat Image Classifier! In this project, you will learn how to build a logistic regression classifier that can recognize cats in images. You will develop your algorithm with a neural network mindset and hone your intuitions about deep learning.

Instructions:

- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
- Use np.dot(X,Y) to calculate dot products.

You will learn to:

- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
- Initializing parameters
- Calculating the cost function and its gradient
- Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

### Deep Neural Network

By the time you complete this notebook, you will have finished the deep neural network classifier to recognize cats.

To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the classifier to recognize cats to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression classifier implementation.

After this project you will be able to:

- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network and apply it to supervised learning.
