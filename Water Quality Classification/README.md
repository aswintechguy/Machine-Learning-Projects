# Water Quality Analysis 

# Dataset Information

Safe drinking water is essential to a healthy life. It is a fundamental human right. Healthy drinking water is vital as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, investing in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

### Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): \
