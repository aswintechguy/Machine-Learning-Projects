**Complete Video Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/Z_iasbvduuM

# Project Information

In this video, we explore anomaly detection in stock prices using techniques like Z-Score, Isolation Forest, and Residual Analysis. We demonstrate how to identify unusual price movements, detect market anomalies, and improve financial data analysis. By leveraging these statistical and machine learning methods, we gain insights into detecting outliers that could indicate potential trading opportunities or risks.
